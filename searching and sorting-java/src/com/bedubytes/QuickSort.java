//Quick Sort
/*
 is a divide and conquer algorithm.
It involves  3 steps
1. Pivot selection - We pick an element and ark it as pivot. The pivot element can be first element, last element or any random element
2. Partitioning - We reorder the array such that all elements smaller that pivot comes before the pivot.
The elements equal to pivot can go either side of the pivot
After this partitioning the pivot is at its correct sorted position
3. Recursion - Recursively apply the above steps on the subarray formed to the left side of the pivot and on the subarray formed on the right side of the pivot
