// Heaps
/*
Heaps come on one or two forms, a min heap or max heap.

We'll focus on the min heaps because a max heap is essentially the reverse
In a min heap the elements are all smaller than their children so the root node will be the very smallest element and then looking down the tree down the heap, the elements get bigger and bigger and bigger

SO that's the basics of what a heap is but how do we actually create and maintain such a data structure

When we insert an element it always goes in the next empty spot looking top to bottom left to right.
